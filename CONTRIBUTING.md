### When opening an issue

1. When opening an issue, please mention the problem encountered in detail, steps to reproduce the issue, tooling & compiler versions used as well as your OS or linux distro version.

2. Please ensure that you have all the dependencies installed as per the instructions before opening a build-error issue.

### When opening a pull-request
